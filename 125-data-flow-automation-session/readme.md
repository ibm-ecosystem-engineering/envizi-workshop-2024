# Dataflow Automation

This document explains about Dataflow Automation and how to use how to use this to integrate data into Envizi.

## About Dataflow Automation

Data Flow Automation is IBM Envizi’s solution to simplify and streamline the process of provisioning data services and loading account data into Envizi.

The three main components are:
- Data Services
- Data Pipelines
- Monitoring and Logging

#### Data Services

Data Services are configured to provide endpoints for data to be delivered for ingestion into Envizi. Supported data services are: 
- Cloud Storage (Amazon S3)
- Mailbox address (Amazon Simple Email)
- SFTP folder (Amazon Transfer)
- Data ETL (IBM App Connect)

#### Data Pipelines

A Data Pipeline defines how a data file will be processed by Envizi. A Data Pipeline has the following configuration:

## 3. Sending UDC excel to S3

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>

Lets use the sample python script [main.py](./python/main.py) to push the [data.xlsx](./python/data.xlsx) file into S3 now. 


1. Download the `main.py` and `data.xlsx` files into a folder.

2. Update the `Location` column in the `data.xlsx` with the some existing location in your envizi environment.

3. Open the linux/mac terminal window and goto folder where you downloaded the `main.py` file.

4. Instal the `boto3` for python if it is not available in your system.
```
python -m pip install boto3
```

5. Run the below command with your S3 Data service values.
```
export s3_BUCKET_NAME=envizi-client-dataservice-us-prod
export s3_FOLDER_NAME=client_9608cd600af647
export s3_ACCESS_KEY=AKIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export s3_SECRET_KEY=axhHxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```
6. Run the below command to push the file to S3
```
python main.py
```

you may get the output like this..
```
S3Handler  ...
 ENVIZI_S3_AWS_BUCKET_NAME : envizi-client-dataservice-us-prod
 ENVIZI_S3_AWS_FOLDER_NAME : client_9608cd600af647
output/results-10122023-110535-725742/POC Account Setup and Data Load_G1_20231012-110543.xlsx is uploaded to envizi-client-dataservice-us-prod  : client_9608cd600af647/POC Account Setup and Data Load_G1_20231012-110543.xlsx
2023-10-12 11:05:45,747 - INFO:127.0.0.1 - - [12/Oct/2023 11:05:45] "POST /api/turbo/query HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

The envizi should have processed your file now.

7. Goto file delivery status screen by Clicking on `File Delivery Status`

You can see the status of your file.
