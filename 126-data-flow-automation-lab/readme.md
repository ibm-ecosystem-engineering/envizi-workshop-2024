### 3.1. Data Load Issue - Verify logs

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>


If the file is not processed and showing the Error in the Load Status of the file delivered to S3 as below, then verify the Parse errors and Load erros

1. In Envizi UI `Admin` > `Data Flow Automation`  > `File Delivery Status`
<img src="images/Envizi-AWS-S3-using-Postman-LoadIssue-1.png">

2. Select File with error 

3. Click `Actions` > `Loading logs`
<img src="images/Envizi-AWS-S3-using-Postman-LoadIssue-2.png">

4. View the `File Status`

5. Click on `Actions` 
<img src="images/Envizi-AWS-S3-using-Postman-DF-FileDelivery-ShowParseError.png">

6. Click on `Parse Errors` to check if any parsing errors
   
<img src="images/Envizi-AWS-S3-using-Postman-DF-FileDelivery-ParseError.png">

7. You can see if there are any errors. In the above screen-shot it shows the file content seems to be coming as garbage data instead of actual data.
The error message : 
Unable to match the current row with any of the row specifications.File specification "Envizi_POC_Account_Setup_And_Data_Load". Row number 1

8. For this particular garbage data issue, it seems like the file is somehow got corrupted on the source machine where Postman is running. This got resolved when we restarted the Postman. However, you need to check based on the error message.

9. Similarly, you can check `Load Errors`
