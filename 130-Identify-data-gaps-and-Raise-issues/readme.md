# Monitor Health of Data and identify issues.

In this lab exercise we will monitor the health of the data by looking into Envizi Reports available out of the box. The Reports will provide the details on data gaps / arrears , etc at various levels such as  account, data type, Supplier level.  Based on the insights from the reports, we will take necessary actions to address the gaps / arrears.


# 1. Check Data Quality of the Accounts

Envizi provides the below reports to understand the quality of data and also helps us to identify the gaps / missing data so that users can take necessary action. 

1. Account Data health check 
2. Account Incomplete Report

# 1.1. Power Report: Account Data health check

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>

Account Data health check is a power report which helps us to analyze health of data loaded into the accounts in Envizi. By looking into the report, the data capture team can understand what % of accounts have the data captured in last 4 months and what is the % of accounts for which data need to be catpured. 

In this section we will go through these reports and get the insights on the data which we have so far loaded into accounts for our organization.

### Account Information

Looking at the `Last Date of Data` column (eg: June 30, 2023) , the data capture team can identify that they need to capture the latest data into these accounts and work on it further.  For example, at the time of this report (refer screenhot - Last updated on 09/12/2023 03:07 AM),  its been more than 4 months  that the data is not captured into these accounts, hence identified as arrears.

## 1.1.4 Data Gaps

10. Lets go back to `Home` page and look at the `Data Gaps`. The bar graphs under `Data Gaps` section shows that from July 2023 there is lot of accured data, which  means the

<img src="images/Account-Data-health-check-DataGaps-1.png"> 

This gives you more details insights on how much data is loaded, how much is estimate and accrued for this data type.
