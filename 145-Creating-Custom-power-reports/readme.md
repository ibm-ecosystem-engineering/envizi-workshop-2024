# Creating Custom Power Reports in Envizi

PowerReports can be viewed, edited and saved, and kept private or shared with other Envizi users within your organization.  This gives users the freedom to navigate and respond to the changing reporting requirements of your organization.

In this lab exercise you will explore about the How to create a new custom Power Reports in Envizi .

#### Pre-Requisite

1. Get your `Prefix-Id` from your Instructor. This id to be prefixed in all your data to avoid duplicate records. Your `Prefix-Id` could be in the format `MU11`, `MU12`.

## 1 PowerReport Edit Permission

For customers who want to build their own reports, PowerReports can be built using Standard Datasets, available with their relevant modules:

There are 3 datasets available in Envizi.

### 2.1 Monthly Dataset

The Monthly Dataset is a comprehensive dataset containing monthly aggregated data from your Envizi platform. It powers the majority of Standard PowerReports across many modules and can be leveraged to build powerful custom reports directly in the Envizi platform.

A comprehensive dataset containing consolidated monthly data, which includes support for data type groups, ratios, and a range of standard data objects.

### 2.2 Survey Dataset

The Survey Dataset supports reporting on surveys and scorecards (Surveys which include scoring) in Envizi's PowerReport framework.

The dataset includes all survey responses for all surveys that have at least one question answered. If a respondent has not filled in any answers, that Locationâ€™s (which could represent a third party like a supplier or investee) survey response will not be included.

A dataset containing survey responses and scoring for scorecard-type surveys.

### 2.3 Daily Dataset
