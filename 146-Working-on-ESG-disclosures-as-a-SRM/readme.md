# Working on ESG disclosures as a Sustainability Reporting Manager (SRM)

In this lab exercise you will learn how to leverage Sustainability Reporting Manager Module of Envizi to help create the ESG disclosures and work on the same. 

In this lab, we will use various role plays who would do the following.
- Create disclosure
- Work on disclosure questions
- Review the responses
- Approve to the completion

We will basically follow the workflow as shown here from end-to-end, create disclosure, assign ownership, complete the disclosure.

<img src="images/SRM-workflow.png">

To do this lab with various personas, we should have the following users created with the roles provided in the table under column named `Access + Special Role`. To create the users and logins please refer [User creation lab exercise](/161-Creating-Contacts-and-Users-using-ui/readme.md) and create the following users by logging into Envizi with `System Administrator` role.  The SRM Persona will be defined in the SRM module while working on the disclosures.

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>SRM Persona</th>
        <th>First Name</th>       
        <th>Username</th>
        <th>Access Role</th>
        <th>Special Role</th>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>SRM</td>        
        <td>Your Envizi Admin User</td>
        <td>Your Envizi Admin User</td>
        <td>System Administrator</td>
        <td>SRM Role</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
        <td>SRM Owner (Disclosure Owner)</td>
        <td>xxx_SRM Owner</td>

In this lab, we have learnt how an organization can use Envizi to create an ESG Disclosure for their annual ESG reporting disclosure requirements including various frameworks. We have also learnt how different personas with different roles such as disclosure owner, assignee, reviewer and approver, can participate in the disclosure preparation and bring to completion.
